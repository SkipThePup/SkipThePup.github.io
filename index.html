                        Zizou only wore the jerseys of four clubs. He started his career at Cannes on the french league. Later he was signed
                        by the Girondins of Bourdeux; this is where the started to shine and bloom reaching the final of the 1996 UEFA Cup.
                        Next he would join his first big club, Juventus; during this time he would establish himself as one of Europe's finest,
                        he would win two Serie A's titles and reach two Champions League finals. The last club of his career was Real Madrid which
                        they would pay a record-breaking transfer fee; as a "merengue", Zizou won his first and only Champions League, scoring the
                        winning goal -goal which is still remebered today and considered the best goal on a Champions League final. He would retire
                        on 2006 against a match versus Villarreal.

                        As an international team player, Zidane won the most significant cups any player could win: the World Cup and the Euro Cup. On both
                        tournament he would have a significant role and scored important goals. He was and is still considered a national hero. Even
                        close to his retirement, Zizou was close to win his second World Cup in 2006, getting a red card on the final and eventually loosing
                        to Italy.
