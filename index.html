    GUI Assignment: HW5: Implementing a Bit of Scrabble with Drag-and-Drop
    Description: File contains all the data for the creation of a line of Scrabble. The html containers consist of a game board, a score
    label, a holder where we place the player's letters and a button to restart the game.
    We will make use of the JQuery UI library in the _js.js file.
    We also use a data structure that holds information about the Scrabble letter tiles. I used the data structure provided by the professor in the zip file.

    DISCLAIMER: Most of this code was obtained by reading w3schools.com tutorials, unless noted
